# *Data Analysis using Visualizations*

Using a countplot, I was able to discover that the South East region has the most number of individuals from this data set. I used a boxplot to graph the charges of male and female in each region. The individuals of the South East region had the highest set of charges compared to other regions. According to the graph, males pay more than women. The average for all the region's charges falls around 10,000 for both males and females. I also plotted a boxplot to graph the charges of smokers and non-smokers in each region. On average across the regions, smokers pay 30,000 in charges while non-smokers pay a little short of 10,000. Smokers pay about 3 times more than non-smokers for medical costs. Using a barplot, I plotted the charges by age. The older you get, the more you end up paying for medical costs. The answers to my research questions were as expected. Although, it is very interesting that males pay much more then women. The visualizations were very helpful in understanding the dataset.
