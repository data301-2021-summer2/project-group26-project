# *Data Analysis using Visualizations*

***Research Questions***

- Which regions have the highest charges(based on this sample data)? 
- How does the medical insurance cost vary as a function of a single variable such as age, region,  and sex, or a combination of attributes (e.g. age, sex, and smoking)? 
- Which regions have the more expensive charges as a whole?Which regions have the more expensive charges as a whole, while comparing Males and Females?
- How much more do smokers pay then non-smokers in each region?
- Which ages have the highest charges? Which ages have the lowest charges?

Using a countplot, I was able to discover that the South East region has the most number of individuals from this data set. I used a boxplot to graph the charges of male and female in each region. The individuals of the South East region had the highest set of charges compared to other regions. According to the graph, males pay more than women. The average for all the region's charges falls around 10,000 for both males and females. I also plotted a boxplot to graph the charges of smokers and non-smokers in each region. On average across the regions, smokers pay 30,000 in charges while non-smokers pay a little short of 10,000. Smokers pay about 3 times more than non-smokers for medical costs. Using a barplot, I plotted the charges by age. The older you get, the more you end up paying for medical costs. Individuals who are 21 years old have the lowest charges, while individuals who are 64 years old have the highest charges. The answers to my research questions were as expected. Although, it is very interesting that males pay much more then women. The visualizations were very helpful in understanding the dataset.
