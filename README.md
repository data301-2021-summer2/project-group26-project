## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I am interested to explore the cost of medical insurance in the USA as a function of single or combined variables. This dataset explains the cost of a small sample of USA population Medical Insurance Cost based on some attributes such as age, sex, bmi, etc. This dataset is used in practice in [Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-R-Brett-Lantz/dp/1782162143), but the data is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance/home). It is simulated on the basis of demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau, according to the book.  The data was created on 2018-02-21, no specific date was provided on when it was collected. The purpose of the dataset is to show the relationship between attributes and the population medical cost insurance. From these relationships, we can deduct certain trends. The data was collected by the US Census Bureau, but no method of collection was outlined. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

During this analytics project, I hope to find relationships between the attributes and the cost. I am interested in this dataset because I am planning to move to the United States of America for work after I graduate from UBCO. This processed data will help me make an informed decision as to where I would like to work. The questions I want to explore are as follows. Are any relevant corralection between the ratio of multiple quantitative variables; such as age/bmi vs charges/children? Which regions have the highest charges(based on this sample data)? How does the medical insurance cost vary as a function of a single variable such as age, region,  and sex, or a combination of attributes (e.g. age, sex, and smoking)? Can we plot the regions with oldest population and higest charges? I believe that this dataset is perfect for building a user-facing Dashboard.
