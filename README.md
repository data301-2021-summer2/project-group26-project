I am interested in the Medical Cost Personal Dataset. This dataset explains the cost of a small sample of USA population Medical Insurance Cost based on some attributes such as age, sex, bmi, etc. This dataset is used in practice in [Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-R-Brett-Lantz/dp/1782162143), but the data is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance/home). It is simulated on the basis of demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau, according to the book from which it is from. The data was collected around 2017/2018, no specific date was provided. The purpose of the dataset is to show the relationship between attributes and the population medical cost insurance. From these relationships, we can deduct certain trends. The data was collected by the US Census Bureau, but no method of collection was listed.
