You should remain focused on your research question(s) - it is very easy to get lost down rabbit holes in data analyses projects.

If you find that your research questions are not that interesting, or you find more interesting questions (especially after your EDA) you may revise them, or add more.

Use the lab times, as well as our office hours (TAs and instructors), to get help and guidance on your analyses.

You should experiment with “plenty of” data visualizations to try and visualize your dataset and answer your research questions.

Give us a narrative/story of your explorations as you go along, in-line with your data - use the new Markdown skills you learned in Task 1!
